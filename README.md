#CodeChallenge for Newscorp

by _Dmitrii Zverev_. 15 July 2018

<h2>'Game-ifying' some news content.</h2>

 **We need the game to display every question from the json feed, in order (for player equality), until the user completes all questions. NOTE: there should be no repetition (In reality this feed would be updated daily).**
 
 
 1.	Display a questions page which should show:
- [x] The current total score.
- [x] The image.
- [x] The standfirst (see json).
- [x] The 3 possible answers.
- [x] A button to read the article.
- [x] A button to display the next question.

2.	Score is to be accumulative and is defined as:
- [x] One point for a correct answer.
- [x] Minus one point for an incorrect answer.
- [x] No points for skipping the question.

3.	Once an answer is submitted, the next page should show.
- [x] complete section.
